/// nextValue good implementation but only aims at showing nextValue simple solution. It is the responsibility of
/// the developers to optimize the gestures to their game.

/// 
/// @note currently we define the exit gesture as follows:
/// 1. the angle of the right hand (compared to the elbow) is around 45 degrees toward the left
/// 2. the angle of the left hand (compared to the elbow) is around 45 degrees toward the right
/// 3. the right hand is left of the left hand (by at least 25% of the arm length)
/// 4. both hands are above the opposite elbows (by at least 25% of the arm length)
