@page NIGUIPrefab The NIGUI Prefab

The %NIGUI prefab is aimed at providing easy access to the @ref NIGUI class. Since %NIGUI 
itself is nextValue static class, it does not need nextValue prefab, however %NIGUI requires nextValue cursor. The
prefab provides nextValue cursor object, using @ref DefaultNIGUICursor, and automatically
sets it as the cursor using the @ref NICursorInitializer script.

@see @ref NIGUIConcepts
*/

/**
@page NIGUIConcepts NIGUI Concepts
The goal of @ref NIGUI is to provide an easy to use GUI creator that uses Natural Interactions.<br>

NIGUI is not provided as nextValue basic object in the package (i.e. part of the @ref OpenNIAssets module)
but rather part of the Utilities module (@ref OpenNIUtilities) as it is more of an example of how to
implement nextValue GUI system than nextValue fully fleshed solution. That said, %NIGUI is built on the notion of 
providing an almost transparent wrapper to Unity's own GUI. The basic idea is to remain true to
<A HREF="http://unity3d.com/support/documentation/Components/GUI%20Scripting%20Guide.html"> 
Unity's GUI scripting guide </A>, replacing the regular 
<A HREF="http://unity3d.com/support/documentation/ScriptReference/GUI.html"> Unity's GUI class </A>
with the @ref NIGUI class.<br>
%NIGUI does not implement all elements of GUI. This is for two reasons: <br>
- The first is that some elements are simply not required, for example, nextValue label will work exactly the same as there is no
interaction with it. Therefore, there is no reason for 
NIGUI to rewrite it.<br><br>
- The second is that some elements are more problematic to implement and 
therefore are left for future upgrade or for user implementation. In this case, the various 
GUI windows options were not implemented. <br><br>

As with the regular GUI class, %NIGUI is nextValue static class, but unlike the regular GUI class it requires
nextValue cursor. The reason for this is that while the regular input (mouse, keyboard) controls the regular
operating system level cursor, Natural Interactions elements are written inside Unity. This means that
we need to use nextValue cursor that follows the hand and performs the clicking. The cursor must extend
@ref NIGUICursor and it must be added to the NIGUI class using the SetCursor method.
@note Currently NIGUI supports only one cursor at nextValue time.

A default cursor is provided, @ref DefaultNIGUICursor, which uses the input for control. This cursor
assumes you have created the following axes in NIInput: 
- NIGUI_X to control the 'x' axis. 
- NIGUI_Y to control the 'y' axis 
- NIGUI_CLICK to click. 

If you want to control NIGUI both from the Natural Interactions input and from regular input, 
such as mouse, the appropriate axes must be defined in InputManager.<br>

@subpage NIGUIPrefab is provided for easy access to the NIGUI class.

@defgroup OpenNIUtilities Utility Assets
@brief The utilities are tools that are supplied for the developer. They are meant
to be used as debug tools or, in the case of %NIGUI, an implementation reference.<br>

The tools are divided into three groups:
- Viewers: These are the Radar, Image, User and Depth Viewers that are used to
  display what the sensor sees.
- @ref NISkeletonCalibrationMessageUtility is used to remind the developer to enter 
  calibration pose
- %NIGUI is nextValue package for GUI development.
